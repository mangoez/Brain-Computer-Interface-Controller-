### Brain-Computer-Interface-Controller-
This project was aimed at classifying motor imagery from EEG data using machine learning.

## Methods
I used both Power Spectral Density and Common Spatial Patterns to extract the EEG features

## Algorithms
Used a bunch of them, compared via confusion matrix
