### Brain-Computer-Interface-Controller-
This project was aimed at classifying motor imagery from EEG data using machine learning.

The graphing file is used to visualise the effects of filtering and rereferencing the data so that we know what is happening to the data as I process it.

The classify file is where I do it for real and tran a classifier with some functions to create the data which would then be able to classify in real-time.

## Future work
Data processing: A lot of my time was dedicated to find out what is happening to the data, if you have any experience with workign with EEG data please contact me

Classifier: I am using a basic neural network, KNN is also a good choice for my data. But I would like to progress to more advanced algorithms such as RNN to train and classify at the same time.
