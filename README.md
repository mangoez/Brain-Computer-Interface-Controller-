This project was aimed at classifying motor imagery from EEG data using machine learning.

## Methods
I used both Power Spectral Density and Common Spatial Patterns to extract the EEG features

## Algorithms
Used a bunch of them, compared via confusion matrix

## Classes
The two class ones are just left and right hand
The three class ones are left, right and rest
